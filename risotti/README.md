# UNMAINTAINED
# Risotti
These modules are all the GUI customizations I have made.
## General Info
All customizations have a wallpapers directory inside them.

# NixCity
## Concept
### Cybernetic
The intention is to replicate the feeling of living in a metropole with technology, to think of cybernetics.

For the colorscheme I used Enkia's Tokyo Night, with the accent being on the purple #bb9af7, and general text/buttons on the orange #e0af68.
