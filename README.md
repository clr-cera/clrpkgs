# clrpkgs

This is my collection of nix stuff!
## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Adding it to your flake

Add clrpkgs to your `flake.nix`:
```nix
inputs = {
  clrpkgs.url = "github:clr-cera/clrpkgs";
};
```
## üì¶ Packages
All packages I make are inside the packages output, installing a package is as easy as adding this to you configuration:
```nix
environment.systemPackages = [inputs.clrpkgs.packages.${system}.${packageName}];
```
You can see all packages [`here`](pkgs/README.md).
## üì• Overlays
All overlays I make are inside the overlays output, to add them to your overlays, you just need to add this to your nix configuration:
```nix
nixpkgs = {
  overlays = [
    inputs.clrpkgs.overlays.modifications
  ];
};
```
You can see all overlays [`here`](overlays/README.md).
